VERSION 0.2

INTRODUCTION

This is the RDCL library. It provides a framework to connect to the Newton
MessagePad (OS 2.0 and later) via the built-in Dock protocol. Connections
are usually via serial cable, but the higher level protocol layers can
also be run over any other connection method such as TCP/IP.

RDCL is written in Ruby, with a small helper module written in C for
Unix systems to interface with the serial port.

INSTALLATION

RDCL requires Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 on Windows systems, and Ruby 1.9 on Unix systems.
Rake is required for installation.

To install, download the latest RDCL package and extract it. Then, use

  rake compile

to compile the helper module (not needed on Windows) and

  rake install (Windows)

or 

  sudo rake install (Unix)

to install the library and applications. The RDCL library will be installed
in the same directory as other Ruby librarries under rdcl/..., and the
applications will be installed in /usr/local/bin under Unix and
\winnt\system32 under Windows.

APPLICATIONS

nwt: Command line application to interact with the Newton. See

  nwt --help
  
after installation for more information.
